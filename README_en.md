# AI Virtual Mate Web

## Introduction

**AI Virtual Mate Web** is a digital human chat software integrated with advanced artificial intelligence technology, providing a platform for users to interact with virtual characters through a web interface. Users can access the web locally or via a local area network to enjoy real-time voice interaction experiences. The software has rich personalized settings, including the virtual character's name, persona, language model selection, etc., and supports multiple voice synthesis engines and custom API integration.

## Open Source License

This project follows the **GPL-3.0** open source license, encouraging community members to freely use, modify, and distribute the code, while also requiring that derivative works distributed also follow the same open source license.

## Features

- **Multi-language Model Support**: Interfaces with a variety of pre-trained large language models, such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini, etc.
- **Custom API Support**: Users can configure custom APIs according to their needs to achieve integration with specific large language models.
- **Multimodal Voice Synthesis**: Supports various voice synthesis engines such as Microsoft Cloud edge-tts, local pyttsx3, and GPT-SoVITS.
- **Real-time Voice Interaction**: Utilizing advanced voice recognition technology, users can communicate with the virtual mate in real time via voice.
- **Dynamic Web Interface**: A dynamic interaction interface provided by the Flet and Flask frameworks for the web server.
- **Live2D Character Display**: Integrated Live2D technology to display virtual character images, and change mouth shapes in real time according to the results of voice synthesis.

## System Requirements

```

## Usage Instructions

### Launch the Application

Run the `main.py` script in the root directory of the project to launch the application (You need to first complete the image file materials and then place the Live2D model and the Vosk speech recognition model):

```bash
python main.py
```

### Software Settings

- Click the "Software Settings" button at the bottom right of the launcher to enter the settings interface.
- Configure the name, persona, username, password, etc., of the virtual mate.
- Set the voice synthesis engine, speech rate, pitch, and various service port numbers.

### Voice Interaction

- In the main interface of the launcher, select "Enable" from the drop-down menu to activate the real-time voice interaction function.
- Voice input will automatically trigger a conversation with the virtual mate and display in real time in the launcher window.

### Conversation Interface

- Enter text messages in the conversation web page, click the "Send Message" button or press the Enter key to send.
- The response from the virtual mate will be displayed in the chat box.

### Character Display

- Click the "Open Character" button to open the Live2D character display page in the default browser.

### Export Chat History

- Click the "Export History" button at the bottom left of the conversation web page to export the current chat history as a text file.

### Clear Chat History

- Click the "Start New Conversation" button at the bottom left of the conversation web page to clear the current chat history and start a new conversation.

## Technology Stack
